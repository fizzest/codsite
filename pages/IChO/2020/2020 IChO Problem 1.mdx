The most beautiful of cats, the Van cat is a pure breed living only in Lake Van basin. Another endemic cat breed is the Ankara cat. They are called Angora cats. Their most important feature is their two different eye colors.

Just like people, cats can sometimes be stressed and angry. Just as people are made happy by melatonin, the stress of cats can be reduced and they can be made happy thanks to a natural product. Nepetalactone is an organic compound isolated from the plant catnip (_Nepeta__cataria_), which acts as a cat attractant. Nepetalactone is a ten-carbon bicyclic monoterpenoid compound derived from isoprene with two fused rings: a cyclopentane and a lactone.

**1.1.** The above scheme describes the total synthesis of nepetalactone. **Draw** structures of **A** – **G** , without stereochemical details.

_**Hints:**_

- Compound **A** has strong and sharp band at 3300 cm−1 in the IR spectrum.
- **A** , **B,** and **F** are monocyclic, while **C** , **D** , **E** , and **G** are bicyclic compounds.
- **F** has one doublet at ~ 9.8 ppm in the 1H-NMR spectrum.

The above scheme includes a few reactions of one of the enantiopure nepetalactone **1** isomers. Three of the reaction products ( **5** , **6** , and **J** ) are used as insect repellents in industry.

**1.2.** For the relationship between **5** and **6** , which of the following is/are true? **Tick** the box next to the correct answer(s) on your answer sheets.

Reaction of **1** with DDQ gives highly conjugated compound **H**. Also, thermal reaction of compound **H** with _p_-quinone gives **I** with molar mass of 226.28 g/mol.

**1.3.** _**Draw**_ the structures of **H**, **I**, and **J** indicating stereochemistry.

_**Hints:**_

- During the formation of **I** , sequential pericyclic reactions and an oxidation reaction (due to the presence of O2) take place, and a well-known gas forms during the reaction.
- **J** has a strong and very broad band between 3300 and 2500 cm–1 in the IR spectrum.
