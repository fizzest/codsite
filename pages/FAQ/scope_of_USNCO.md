The scope of the USNCO test for both the Locals Exam and the Nationals Part I Exam is as follows. **Any test before 2012 does not follow this format, and therefore not recommended to use them as practice material**.  
> 1. **Stoichiometry/Solutions** (6): Knowledge of your first-year high school general chemistry is tested.
> 2. **Descriptive Chemistry** (3~5): Knowledge of flame tests, ion colors, selective precipitation, and trivial chemistry is tested.
> 3. **Laboratory** (1~3): Human errors, procedures, and lab equipment knowledge is tested.
> 4. **States of Matter** (6): Knowledge of the three types of matter, phase changes, phase diagrams, IMFs, vapor pressure is tested.
> 5. **Thermodynamics** (6): Knowledge of thermocycles, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy is tested here. Although most questions are calculations, there have always been at least one theoretical question.
> 6. **Kinetics** (6): Knowledge of half-life, elementary reactions (including pre-equilibrium and SSA), integrated rate laws, energy diagrams, and reaction rates is tested.
> 7. **Equilibrium** (6): Knowledge of chemical equilibrium (including solubility and acid-base chemistry) is tested.
> 8. **Redox/Electrochemistry** (6): Knowledge of redox reactions and electrochemistry is tested.
> 9. **Atoms** (6): Knowledge of Atomic theory and periodicity is tested.
> 10. **Molecules** (6): Knowledge of bonding and molecular structure is tested.
> 11. **Organic Chemistry** (5): Knowledge of organic chemistry is tested. All of the questions can be answered with Kleins' _Organic Chemistry_.
> 12. **Biochemistry** (1): There is always one biochemistry question, but it's probably not worth your time to study them.  

The Part II Exam contains topics similar to Part I, but the concepts are often combined. Biochemistry and Laboratory topics are never included in Part II.
