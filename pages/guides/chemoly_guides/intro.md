Hey! Thanks for coming here to give this guide a read. It's been two years since I first posted an introductory guide for CODS, and I was genuinely surprised to see how much impact this guide has made towards newcomers to this community known as "Chemistry Olympiad". Considering this acknowledgement of mine, I thought it would only be responsible for me to update this guide, considering I myself have learned a lot over these past two years and many of the sentimental values I've shared in the past is not ideal. Hence, I've completely revamped the guide, removed some of the parts that may be misleading or outright false, and added some information that can really help you throughout your journey.

Enjoy!


# Part 0: Introduction to Competitive Academics
---
Competitive STEM is contradictory. Here's an example.

A lot of people emphasize that science is a "collaborative" field. This is certainly true, and a fundamental part of the field. Without collaboration, Science could not progress at the speed in which it is currently going. However, that does not mean there is no competition. In fact, there is fierce competition- it's not like you're going to be doing research alone. 

Parallel investigations are bound to happen, and they are very common. Here's a very recent example in Chemistry: three different groups, the Wendlandt group from MIT, the Knowles group from Princeton, and the Hartwig group from UC Berkeley- all undertook parallel investigations regarding _contra_-Thermodynamic alkene isomerization.[^8] All three groups are run by spectacular principal investigators, and do really beautiful chemistry. Competitive chemistry really highlights both the thrill and terror of having all kinds of people from different backgrounds come together and compete for the same goal- see how far they can go up the ladder. 

I think chemistry olympiad and all competitive STEM fields share the same spirit, but there's one trap a lot of people competing in these competitions end up falling into. Ignoring the collaboration and embracing the competitive nature. Embracing the individualistic lifestyle. 

This applies to all parts of life. Hobbies, sports, games, etc. It is crucial for your own well being to find a balance between competition and collaboration. Everyone has their own goals, so it is important that you support each other achieve their own goals without giving up your own. Selfish behavior might seem beneficial in the short term, but it will most definitely negatively impact you on the long term. 

Similar to how science progressed at an incredible rate due to the existence of both collaboration and competition, you must also find a good balance between the two in your journey. Do not fall into the toxic mindset that sharing even a small portion your knowledge will only set you at a disadvantage. A mindset that sets competition above all else will make you think that you are better than others, or must be better than your peers. This is a very unhealthy mindset, and often times sets you to a path of straight failure with many "side" traps. As someone who truly struggled with this mindset for the entirety of high school, I highly do not recommend it. Just by having a open mindset, I've personally learned so much in chemistry for the first six months of my freshmen year in college compared to the three years of high school I spent grinding my ass off, reading textbooks and solving USNCO exams alone.

On a similar note, making competitive STEM your character, your personality will also set you up for failure. Let me explain. See if this applies to any of you:

 - [ ] You're on competitive STEM Discord servers constantly and have more online friends than in-person friends.
 - [ ] You constantly day-dream or talk about how you'll make camp next year and everyone is your enemy.
 - [ ] You're constantly overwhelmed with unreasonably huge goals that you set for yourself.
 - [ ] You think you're a different breed from those who don't compete in competitive STEM.
 - [ ] You're obsessed with getting into MIT (or Caltech, or Harvard).
 - [ ] You think making camp will get you into MIT.
 - [ ] You try to humble brag by asking a question in a Discord channel where it's not appropriate in terms of context, or the general skill level.
 - [ ] You complain about cheaters, the score cutoff, how the competition is run.
 - [ ] You are arrogant and focused on how you could beat your competitors, rather than focus on how you could improve in the field.
 - [ ] You idolize campers or international STEM competition medalists.

This is a pretty long, exhaustive list of common pitfalls in terms of competitive STEM. I see a lot of people share these traits on Discord servers, and this really does apply to almost all extracurriculars (ECs): Science Bowl, Quiz Bowl, Science Olympiad, etc.

For those who are just getting into this field, I hope you don't share any of these traits, and don't let these things deter you from this community. There's a lot of amazing people that compete in chemistry Olympiad and it's really a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

For those who have any of these traits, let me explain why they are a problem in terms of finding success in this field. 

## The Problem
---
If you share a lot of the characteristics described above, I have no other way to word this other than you might be pretty unpleasant to talk to from other people's perspectives. Sure, you might not care, but having this personality for three years makes it very hard to fix later on in college life- you'll be lonely and very unapproachable by other people. Once again I'd like to emphasize that Chemistry is a collaborative science, that requires **talking** to your coworkers and other research groups. If you lack mannerisms and keep the arrogant attitude, nobody will want to help you and you're just hurting your chances of actually achieving your goals.

Despite what the modern 21st century might teach you, individualism is a very closed-minded mindset- sure, you might think you can do everything on your own, but this couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to science, in particular. From a high school student's perspective: how could to learn if nobody was there to make the resources, textbooks, and sites to educate you? Thinking you're the "main character" of the entire world will set you up for failure.

ACS (in the context of Chemistry) runs competitive Chemistry with a specific goal in mind. This is within the context of my conversation with Dr. Laura Serbulea, who is the camp mentor for the US team. Chemistry Olympiads' main objective is to allow participants to grow their passion in chemistry so that they can continue on their journey into college and eventually, their academic careers. Surprisingly, most of the achievers in Chemistry Olympiad end up not pursuing a chemistry career after high school- here's some reasons why:

 - **Burnout.** If you invest your everything into Chemistry Olympiad for two or three years, it really does burn you out, especially if you've achieved your main goal (whether that is making camp or making IChO.)
 - **Feeling Isolated.** A lot of previous competitive chemistry participants are at a much higher starting position compared to other college students who have little prior experience with chemistry. This makes them inclined to take higher-level classes much earlier compared to their peers, and because there's that constant age gap, this can make them feel very lonely and isolated. It's especially easy to fall into a pothole where you aren't sure what you're doing and you are envious of your peers that can "fight through" classes together and make friendships that way.
 - **Change in environment.** Again, competitive chemistry is very competitive. Going from an extremely competitive environment where everyone is your "enemy" to a collaborative environment where you must undertake projects with your group members is extremely unsettling if you enjoyed the competitiveness.

Let me go back to the checklist and explain why each trait is not great.

 > You're on competitive STEM Discord servers constantly and have more online friends than in-person friends.
 
 This is not a terrible trait- if you really like competitive chemistry, that's fine. But don't constantly sit at home doing chemistry- it both kills quality of your study sessions and your mental health. Go outside, touch grass. Find a hobby- most of the Nobel Prize winners had one. The idolization of those who are constantly at the lab 24/7 and expectations to do so is a serious issue within the scientific community, and its a serious issue within the Chemistry community as well. Don't do it- please have a life.

Having online friends is great and all, but one thing you must be conscious about is that most people find it easier to talk online and not think before talking. This is probably because you can't see the emotions, facial expressions of those on the receiving end, so you don't consider the other person's perspective as much as you would in a offline conversation.

There's people who are toxic online but very quiet offline- don't adapt that attitude. Sometimes, your toxic personality online can affect your real-life conversations and form bad habits.

 > You constantly day-dream or talk about how you'll make camp next year and everyone is your enemy.

Day-dreaming is a waste of time. Talking about how you'll make camp is a waste of time. Everyone is not your enemy, they can be your useful resources. Why would you make it harder for yourself to achieve your goals by making everyone your enemy? Isn't it easier for you to make them like you and let them help you achieve your goals? Of course, not everyone can like you, but it's still better to keep common sense on the board.

If you're going to talk about how you're going to achieve your goals, it's probably better time management to use that time to actually learn about chemistry. Talking like that only increases your ego, which is your greatest enemy (more info below).

> You're constantly overwhelmed with unreasonably huge goals that you set for yourself.

We'll talk about the trap of overplanning later on.

> You think you're a different breed from those who don't compete in competitive STEM.

I think this is a really common trap competitive STEM participants fall into- thinking their special for competing in a competitive STEM competition. I would like to emphasize here that STEM competitions are not your life. Your purpose should not revolve around STEM competitions. This will only last you a maximum of four years, and after graduating high school, nobody will care. Seriously, it might be a conversation starter, but it won't last you for too long.

There are so many amazing people out there doing other things they are passionate about, and yet there's a lot of people doing competitive STEM because they think it'll give them an image of being really smart or whatever. If you have to prove your worth by how others view you, well, I have nothing to tell you.

> You're obsessed with getting into MIT (or Caltech, or Harvard).
> You think making camp will get you into MIT.

Trying to get into MIT, Caltech, Harvard, or any ivies is extremely difficult when you're applying as an undergraduate student! It's been proven that making camp at USNCO does increase your chances of getting into MIT, but if you have these toxic mindsets, it's very unlikely you'd do well in competitive STEM.. so keep that in mind.

Also, most people only want to apply to these schools for the name value. 

Absolutely, MIT, Harvard, and Princeton have amazing groups that do amazing chemistry, but most students applying to colleges don't have a single idea what the research is about. Learn the necessary knowledge in college to understand the context of the research, and then apply to whatever graduate school interests you most rather than considering the name value of the university.

 - [ ] You try to humble brag by asking a question in a Discord channel where it's not appropriate in terms of context, or the general skill level.

Please don't do this, if you need to inflate your ego please go to a nearby planet fitness gym. (seriously, working out is great for many reasons. I could write another document about this lol)

If you're doing chemistry olympiad for the reputation, just make a new non-profit organization instead. (by the way, if your purpose for opening a NPO is to impress college admissions- this won't work and you're not unique. An admissions officer from MIT have criticized this once in a Science Olympiad award ceremony before, quite a few years ago)

 - [ ] You complain about cheaters, the score cutoff, how the competition is run.

Please worry about improving your chemistry knowledge and ignore the competition when you're taking the exam. It's ok to give criticism if necessary, but if you're not going to tell operations about your problems, it won't be fixed. At that point, you're wasting your time.

 - [ ] You are arrogant and focused on how you could beat your competitors, rather than focus on how you could improve in the field.

Focus on chemistry! Don't think about the other competitors. Consider them your friends that you can learn a thing or two from.

 - [ ] You idolize campers or international STEM competition medalists.

Again, you're wasting your time. If you want to be someone like them, put in the effort.

## The Solution
---
The solution is simple. Put in the effort and enjoy the process. I find it distasteful that people continue to emphasize that MIT "likes campers", primarily because it just makes people fall into the trap of thinking that making camp will determine your chance of going into MIT (seriously, I need to have a conversation with the admissions counseling about this issue. I don't think this is their intention, but it's having a massive effect on competitors.) 

Let me emphasize this: **competitive chemistry has no significance.** You not making camp won't end your chemistry career. Actually, making camp has a higher chance of ending your chemistry career (for reasons stated above). Think of whatever you achieve here as a "bonus reward" for the effort you've put into preparing for this competition. 

Consistency, endurance, and open-mindedness are key traits that makes you successful in not only competitive chemistry, but really any field. Work for these traits. Motivation can help start things, but you must have consistency for your progress to last for any significant amount of time. You will never be motivated forever, but being able to endure your temptations to do something else is a key trait that will help you see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Again, have fun, enjoy the process, and don't act like your life depends on competitive chemistry. It'll be a "phase" you go through in high school, and it won't last forever, but all of the training you've done here will most definitely set you up for success in later stages of life. Trust me, even if you decide to become a bodybuilder, or a businessman, the three traits above will benefit you immensely. My responsibility is for you to avoid any bad traits so that you don't have to deal with breaking those habits later in life.

# Part I: Before getting into Competitive Chemistry
---
Before you start, let's briefly talk about your **mindset** towards the competition. It might seem really silly, but I assure you, this is something you should put a considerable amount of thought on. There are some misconceptions and traps that a lot of people fall into and wonder where they went wrong, so we'll address them here, even before we talk about the competition itself.

## Academic vs. Competitive
---
One of the biggest traps that newcomers fall for is the **inability to differentiate** the "academic" setting with the "competitive" setting. There are many meanings behind this, so let's talk about each one in detail.

An "academic" test that you take in school is very different from a "competitive" test you'd take in Chemistry Olympiad. Not only is the latter much more difficult, but they also heavily differ in terms of their **goal**. While the former tests on your **mastery** of the subject, the latter tests the extent of your ability to apply fundamental knowledge through **problem-solving**. 

As these two totally different tests have different goals, you should **not prepare these tests the same way**. While you'd spend around three weeks at maximum preparing for an "academic" exam, the same is not true for the latter. On average, you'd be spending up to **nine months** preparing for your competition. 

Now that we've got that clear, here are all of the traps you should avoid.

### 1. Do NOT overwork yourself
Pushing yourself is great and all, but overworking is very different from "pushing yourself". When people (and I) mean "push yourself", we mean it in a way that you should try problems that are slightly above your comfort zone, so that you can learn and improve. We do **not** mean you should overwork yourself and continuously cram three chapters of Klein's Organic chemistry reading, two national practice exams, and four chapters of Atkins' Chemical Principles every day. 

Not only will you burn yourself out and hate yourself for getting into this mess, but it's simply not worth it because: 1) People who actually enjoy competitive Chemistry do much better than people who don't and 2) if you aim for completion instead of actually "understanding" what you learned, it won't matter at all.[^1]

Competitive Chemistry should be a fun experience, not a painful one. Do yourself a favor and spread your work so that it's manageable. Take a lot of breaks, exercise, eat well, whatever makes you happy.

### 2. Do NOT overplan
Overworking and Overplanning are the two sins of Competitive Science. Overplanning is the act of planning what you'd do in the future (e.g. in 3 weeks). I and many others have tried out this strategy in the past (especially during summer breaks) and it has caused more harm than anything. Please keep in mind that humans can't foresee the future, and you never know if some concept will cause you trouble or get hit by a car. It is **absolutely crucial** that you don't overplan, as once you fall behind, you'll never be able to catch up and end up being demotivated. 

Remember, your life does not revolve around competitive chemistry. Competitive chemistry is only one aspect of your life and should not be the only thing going in your life. Make sure your priorities are in check, and make sure to spend quality time with your loved ones as well.

### 3. Do NOT read college textbooks for Competitive Chemistry
If Overworking and Overplanning are the two sins of Competitive Science, then reading college textbooks is the grave sin of competitive Chemistry. This is **crucial** advice that everyone tends to ignore, so we'll repeat this many times.

> **A strong, first-year undergraduate general Chemistry along with Organic Chemistry is all you need to be proficient at Chemistry Olympiads.**

No ifs, buts, or ands. Atkins' _Physical Chemistry_ or Housecroft's _Inorganic Chemistry_ will **not** help you in competitive Chemistry, **at all**. These are college-level courses that are not made for quirky smart high-school students like you[^2], and often require math skills above single-variable calculus. Let me repeat again: 

> **A strong, first-year undergraduate general Chemistry along with Organic Chemistry is all you need to be proficient at Chemistry Olympiads.**

While it is true that advanced topics such as physical chemistry aims to develop a better understanding of our chemical world, most, if not all, Chemistry Olympiads will not test your knowledge on something that can only be found from a physical or inorganic chemistry textbook. You should focus on mastering the **fundamentals**, as they are all you need to be proficient in this competition. 

You'll need a strong foundational knowledge of the fundamentals to utilize what you learn from these advanced topics anyways, so don't bother for now.

> **A strong, first-year undergraduate general Chemistry along with Organic Chemistry is all you need to be proficient at Chemistry Olympiads.**

### 4. Do NOT focus on textbooks
While preparing an school exam likely consists of doing some textbook problems, competitive Chemistry questions tend to be **much more challenging** than textbook problems (at least, in Chemistry[^3]). While it is completely fine to review your fundamental knowledge through these textbook problems (and you should!), please avoid solving every single exercise and homework problem, as: 1) they'll get boring, 2) you'd be practicing plug-and-chug which is acceptable in an academic setting but **unacceptable** in an Olympiad setting, and 3) you'll be more vulnerable towards falling into deliberate tricks present in some Chemistry Olympiad problems.

Yes, muscle memory is a real thing, so it's important you always keep your radar on so that you don't make any silly mistakes.

### 5. Try to utilize all kinds of resources
A textbook isn't always the best place to learn, and this is especially true if your Chemistry Olympiad competition has specific "Advanced Topics" present that may be absent from the fundamental knowledge I've addressed multiple times above. 

The best place to learn these topics are through our guides (work-in-progress), online lectures, [ChemGuide](https://www.chemguide.co.uk/), Wikipedia, etc. 

### 6. Don't be afraid
You know what's more scary than bombing your first exam? Not taking enough practice exams and bombing your real competition. It sucks, so don't do it. 

Once you are comfortable applying your fundamental knowledge to homework problems, you should jump into practicing past exams right away![^4] Unlike your high school exams (where past exams are often private), past exams of Chemistry competitions are publicly available.

### 7. Treat Competitive Chemistry differently 
My final advice is this: you should (at least try to) enjoy your experience of both preparing for and competing in the Chemistry Olympiad.

In fact, there are more similarities between competitive Chemistry and video games in comparison to competitive Chemistry and academic Chemistry.

**Consider this:** When you start a new game, you normally go through a tutorial to learn about the rules. After absorbing the basics, you start playing the game. You find the game pretty enjoyable and want to get better, so you practice until you reach a point when you think you've reached a limit. You can tackle almost any situation that is given to you, but there are certain specific situations where advanced techniques could come in handy. So to become even better, you start to learn new strategies and advanced techniques that might aid you in certain situations. 

This analogy can be applied to really anything: chess, speed cubing, learning an instrument, learning how to code, Lego, and of course, competitive chemistry!

Make sure to keep this ordering in mind, and take all the time you need until you get the hang of each step of the learning process!

I'd like to emphasize this one last time: **Chemistry Olympiad exams tend to be very different compared to your regular Chemistry test in high school.**

Unlike the chemistry you learn in an academic setting, competitive Chemistry will be challenging but also interesting, asking problems you've never considered or provide an unique scenario, requiring you to think and strategize. 

I'd also like to emphasize this one last time as well: **People who truly enjoy Chemistry Olympiad tends to do much better than people who don't.**

## Characteristics all Chemistry Olympiads share
---
### Rules
Most rules for the National Chemistry Olympiads in different countries are structured similarly to the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO). The largest requirement is **age restriction**. If the participant is over 20 years old after the July 1st of the year IChO is held, that individual cannot participate in the IChO. Therefore, it is very common that this restriction also applies to many national Olympiads.

Resources that are permitted varies a lot between countries. We highly recommend you conduct your own research on what your country allows, especially with calculator restrictions. The difference between a _graphing calculator_, _scientific calculator_, and _calculators with built in CAS_, and a _four-function calculator_ are significant and we highly recommend you follow their standards. Here are the recommendations for each type:
> * **Graphing Calculators**: Any variation of TI-84  
> * **Scientific Calculators**: TI-36X Pro, Casio fx-991EX (ClassWiz)  

If your country permits a graphing calculator, they can be acquired cheaply from the secondhand market. However, many countries (including the United States) only permit scientific calculators and the administration will not allow you to use a graphing calculator.

### Speed vs. Accuracy
Besides a fundamental knowledge, the Chemistry Olympiad heavily tests your ability of **solving problems fast** and **solving problems accurately**. Both of these features can be acquired by taking a lot of practice tests (experience) with a set time. As you will often be under a lot of time pressure, it is wise to develop a strategy in terms of time management before taking your national exam.

Here are some tips for developing speed:
* If you don't think you can tackle a question, skip them for later.
* You can skip through some "unnecessary steps" in your solution. Make sure anyone who has some knowledge of Chemistry can understand what you're doing, however.  
* Devise a plan in terms of the order of the questions you will be taking, assuming your national Olympiad has a concrete format.

While speed is a necessary component of the national Olympiad, it is highly recommended you work on problem-solving skills **first** rather than speed. You will not perform well if you manage to complete the exam, but make very silly mistakes in the process. Many of the national Olympiads are trying to trick you and fall into traps, so you must practice to avoid them even under high pressure.

Here are some tips for developing problem-solving:
* Do **not** rely on the answer key. If you don't give much thought into the question and look at the answer key immediately, you will not develop a very strong intuition of chemistry problem-solving. The best competitors are those who can utilize their experiences to solve different problems, not those who can only replicate the solution.[^5]  
* Read **the entire problem slowly and carefully**. While it sounds silly, David Morin's word says it best:

> *There's no better way to waste time than to read a problem quickly in an effort to save time. If you miss a piece of the given information, you'll end up just spinning your wheels, trying to solve an unsolvable problem.*

* There are many ways to approach a problem. You can try making **approximations**[^6], **draw a diagram**, **reverse engineer**, etc.

### Mathematics
Mathematics skills are commonly encountered at the secondary school level, such as:
> * Solving qudratic equations
> * Using logarithms and exponentials
> * Solving system of equations
> * Basic trigonometry
> * Basic geometry (Pythagoras' theorem)
> * Basic statistics (plotting graphs, mean, etc.)
> * _sometimes_ Integration and Differentiation (if it is included as one of the "Advanced Topics")

Most approximations in Chemistry are made when solving for variables. For instead, it can be very useful in certain scenarios where the Newton-Raphson approximation of solutions to functions apply and save a tremendous amount of time. For example, assuming A is many magnitudes larger than B, we can make the approximation that:

![](https://i.imgur.com/px3hVgW.png)

This is a very simple approximation that is widely used throughout chemistry, but there are more sophisticated approximations such as Taylor series that may be used.

# Part II: Preparation of Chemistry Olympiads

The three steps you should take to prepare for your competition is this:

> 1. Obtain a fundamental understanding of Chemistry
> 2. Practice problem-solving
> 3. Advanced Knowledge (Optional)[^7]
> 4. Profit

## Obtain a fundamental understanding of Chemistry
There are many great textbooks and resources for learning the fundamentals of chemistry. Which one to use depends on your prior chemistry knowledge. Everyone starts differently; some may already have an appreciable background in chemistry (e.g. took AP Chemistry or have a background in physics), but others may have absolutely zero experience. Either way, I have a recommendation for everyone.

> **NOTE:** You should read whatever your reading at least two times, to ensure you do not have holes in your fundamental knowledge.

### For those with an appreciable physics background:
 There are four types of forces you learn in physics: strong force, weak force, gravitation, and of course, electromagnetism. 

Chemistry is a topic that revolves around the concept of electromagnetic force, and therefore those with an appreciable physics background will likely pick up chemistry much easier than others.

In fact, some of the topics you'll see in chemistry will be very similar (or exactly the same) to physics. This includes: thermodynamics, atomic theory, and gas laws. 

Peter Atkins' _Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight_ is recommended for this group of people. Anything above 4th edition is perfectly fine to use. Even if you don't have any prior experience with chemistry, the _Fundamentals_ section will provide you enough context to get through the textbook.

![Different editions of Atkins textbooks](https://i.imgur.com/V0pkoxN.png)   


### For those with an appreciable chemistry background:
If you took AP/IB Chemistry at school, Atkins' _Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight_ will be perfectly fine to start with. If you've just finished the course, it might be even possible to skip the _Fundamentals_ section. If you haven't taken a chemistry course in a while, it may be wise to look at the _Fundamentals_ section just as a crash course.


### For those who have Chemistry 1 background or do not have a background in Calculus:
If you just took your first year of chemistry in high school, the book above might be a fairly challenging read, especially if you don't know any calculus.

Zumdahls' *Chemistry* is recommended for this group of people. Anything above 7th edition is perfectly fine to use. It's a much easier read than Atkins (textbook mentioned above), and covers a decent amount of fundamentals.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/YxzCPAj.png)   

It is highly recommended that you read Atkins after you complete Zumdahl's *Chemistry* for a stronger foundation!

### For those who do not have a chemistry background:
This group of people is recommended to pick up Zumdahls' *Chemistry*. I'm aware that this might be a difficult read especially if this is your first time studying Chemistry, so Khan Academy is not a bad idea as a supplementary resource.

### For those who hate reading textbooks: 
With numerous amounts of open educational resources, there are many choices to choose from.

[MIT 5.111](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/) and UC Irvine's [Open Chemistry course](http://ocw.uci.edu/openchem/openchem.html) are two great choices in my opinion. Although they are not *quite* enough for a strong foundation, you can use our CODSnotes as a supplement to these lectures, or read the relevant sections of Atkin's _Chemical Principles_.


### Taking Notes

> Notes are a preference— you should take them if you’re used to taking them. If you do take notes, however, make sure you actually use them for review! If you don’t, the extra time spent on those notes would be meaningless. The [CODSnotes](http://chem.isodn.org/notes) written by myself are an alternative to taking notes on Atkin's *Chemical Principles*.  

So this is what I've said previously, but I will make this clear right now.

If you are able to use notes properly, they will significantly benefit you. I can't go into too much detail, but when taking notes, make sure you are able to prioritize information when reading through a textbook. A good textbook will emphasize which is crucial knowledge (**fundamentals**) and which is trivial. On your first read, make things simple and only write down the main points. That way, when you come back to it (which you should frequently), you won't be overwhelmed with information.

On your second read, you can pick up those less important trivial facts and put them in your notes so that you can differentiate what is more important than the other.

### OK, so I've read Atkins.
Congratulations! You know more chemistry than 99% of people in the world! Give yourself a pat in the back.

## Practice problem-solving
---
This is where you apply your fundamental knowledge to actual competitive Chemistry problems. Every competition is different, so you should read a guide below that is relevant to your situation. However, here are some general tips:

### Writing Solutions
After grading many tests from CODS competitions, this is a tip especially relevant if you are solving a free-response problem.

You should think about how you want to present your solution to a problem **before** you start writing. Disregarding this step often leads to a confusing, unorganized solution. Make sure you're writing your solutions neatly with full sentences, so that the grader can easily understand your solution. Make sure your variables are properly defined so that any educated person can know what you're doing.

Make your solutions **clear** and **legible**. Don't let the pressure get to you and make illogical mistakes!

### More Problem Solving Techniques
If you're interested in problem solving techniques, *Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics* by David Morin is a fantastic book, especially if you're also interested in competitive physics. 

Of course, the book itself isn't for competitive chemistry students like us, but the problem solving skills included are so valuable. Luckily, you can read most of the problem solving techniques at [Amazon's preview](https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Solutions-Introductory-Mechanics-David/dp/1482086921/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=morin%20physics&qid=1599678550&sr=8-1).


## Advanced Knowledge (Optional)
Recall that you should only be learning these after you have successfully completed the previous two steps.

### Inorganic Chemistry
> ***Miessler's Inorganic Chemistry***: The textbook is compact, concise, and overall provides a decent introduction to the field, although some of its explanations are rather confusing and difficult to understand.  
> ***Housecroft's Inorganic Chemistry***: The textbook is long, detailed, and very dense. Most of its explanations are simple, but it contains a lot of trivial knowledge that isn't required for the Chemistry Olympiads exam.  

### Organic Chemistry
> ***Klein's Organic Chemistry***: well explained, simple, introductory, focused on mechanisms. This is the only organic chemistry textbook that is truly required for Chemistry Olympiads, but might not be sufficient for competitions harder or equivalent to IChO.  
> ***Clayden's Organic Chemistry***: Well explained, detailed, also focused on mechanisms, but also very well organized. This is one of the best books in the field of Organic Chemistry, but very overkill for most Chemistry Olympiads.  
> **Advanced Organic Chemistry Textbooks**: Carey and Grossman are popular, but these are often for graduates and you wouldn't be reading these textbooks for Chemistry Olympiads.  

### Physical Chemistry
> ***Atkins' Elements of Physical Chemistry***: well explained, decent introduction to physical chemistry, and doesn't go into too advanced mathematics. If you are truly interested in this field, you should check out this book. It is the middle ground between _Atkins' Chemical Principles_ and _Atkins' Physical Chemistry_.  
> ***Atkins' Physical Chemistry***: A typical Physical Chemistry textbook that is used by many colleges. Although it isn't very special. Not recommended.
> ***McQuarrie's Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach***: This is infamously known to be one of the best physical chemistry textbooks to be ever written.

### Analytical Chemistry
> ***Harris' Quantiative Chemical Analysis***: For an analytical chemistry textbook, it's a very decent book. It's great practice for advanced calculations (with good practice problems) and is a decent read. 

## Profit
Ok, if you've made it this for into the guide, first of all, thank you so much for reading this. Months of my colleague's experiences and my own personal experience were combined together to deliver this one heck of a masterpiece guide. 

After you've gotten good at your nation's Chemistry Olympiad, you may wonder, is there any additional steps I can take, such as preparing for the international Chemistry Olympiad, or just trying out more challenging problems?

Question answered. 

[^1]: And no, writing notes with your cram session won't "magically" make you remember everything.
[^2]: For more information in the role of advanced topics, you should read _the Calculus Trap_ by Richard Rusczyk [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/articles/avoid-the-calculus-trap).
[^3]: The one exception I can think of (with my limited knowledge) is physics textbooks. In particular, Red Morin and maybe Halliday. 
[^4]: If your Chemistry Olympiad doesn't have any publicly available practice exams, you can either try out 1) Past exams of Olympiads that are known to be good quality 2) Past exams that have a similar structure to your nation's Chemistry Olympiad competition 3) [Join](https://discord.gg/cf7RN82) our community and ask people who are competing in the same country as you.
[^5]: It is definitely OK to look at the solution manual when **you are stuck**, and you should (unless you really like a challenge). We are just recommending you not **rely** on the solution manual without giving it a proper shot.
[^6]:  in very hard Olympiad questions, this might even be necessary to avoid solving insane equations on time
[^7]: We put advanced topics _after_ problem-solving for many reasons. It is optional because you'll never use it 99% of the time; but we've added it here because these advanced topics are very interesting, especially when you actually have the capability to fully understand it.
[^8]: search it up on google.
