# ACOT '20
---
We had 29 individuals competing in ACOT. The competition was held on **September 27th, 2020 and November 21~22nd**. This was a completely original competition proposed by Kwanwoo "Fizzest" Park and was written by our Contest Curator Team (Alec "apc1234567" Zhu, Stabell, Maestron, and Fizzest). This competition was divided into two dates due to lack of staff.
