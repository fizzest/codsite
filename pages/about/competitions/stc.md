# CODSCT '20
---
We had 14 teams (74 individuals) competing in CODSCT. The competition was held in **April 4th and 5th, 2020** as a direct replacement of the WUCT, which was cancelled due to increasing coronavirus cases in Illinois. This competition, as a direct replacement (but much harder) of WUCT, was first proposed by Alec "apc1234567" Zhu with the 2020 USA IChO team contributing to writing these questions. Kwanwoo "Fizzest" Park and Elizabeth "Ayame" Davis (Ayame) was involved in coordinating the competition.
